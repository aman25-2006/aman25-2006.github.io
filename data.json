    "bio": "Hello! I'm Aman Kumar, a passionate and curious Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) student. I\u2019m currently in my early semesters, building a strong foundation in computer science and programming.\r\n\r\nI have hands-on experience with Python and C, and I\u2019m comfortable working on logic-building, basic data structures, and problem-solving tasks. Alongside this, I\u2019ve started exploring the basics of cloud computing and have a growing interest in AWS (Amazon Web Services) and how cloud platforms can power real-world applications.\r\n\r\nI'm actively looking for opportunities \u2014 workshops, internships, or collaborations \u2014 that help me apply what I\u2019m learning in college to practical, real-world scenarios.\r\n\r\nApart from academics, I enjoy staying updated with the latest in tech, participating in coding challenges, and working on personal growth.\r\n\r\n",
